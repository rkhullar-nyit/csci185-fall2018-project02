## Project 02

### Instructions

After cloning the repository with Intellij initialize the tests.

``` sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

### Objective

You have been tasked with implementing a generic doubly linked list.


### Instructions

1. Take a look at the examples within ```LinkedListDemo```.
2. Complete the methods for the ```LinkedListNode``` class.
3. Complete the methods for the ```LinkedList``` class.

## Grading

Use the test runner located as ```tests/TestRunner.java``` to estimate your grade.
You can also run the unit tests directly for more detailed messages.
Remember to commit and push your code to your github repository.

### Project Reflection
1. What are the purpose of generic classes in Java. Why not create a linked list for ```Object``` only?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the linked list over an array?
